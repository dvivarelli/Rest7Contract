  "label": "Publication",
  "type": "entitytype",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://dspace7-entities.atmire.com/rest/api/core/entitytypes/1"
    },

    }
  }
}

## Relationship Types for the current Item Type
**/api/core/entitytypes/<:id>/relationshiptypes**

A sample can be found at https://dspace7-entities.atmire.com/rest/#https://dspace7-entities.atmire.com/rest/api/core/entitytypes/1/relationshiptypes
It embeds the [relationshiptypes](relationshiptypes.md) which are linked to the given item type (either on the left or right side)

## Get Entity type from label

A sample request would be https://dspace7-entities.atmire.com/server/#/server/api/core/entitytypes/label/Person

There's always at most one entity type per label.

It would respond with:
* The single entity type if there's a match
* 404 if the entity type doesn't exist
